Toefl ibt exam ( new format) : my experience TOEFL Writing Hi everyone I passed
the toefl ibt exam (new format) today in a test center and I would like to share
my experience and give you some insight about what it looks like. So let's get
started: I only had two weeks to prepare for the exam and here's what I did :
First i wanted to have a general idea of what the new format will be like ( I
read on the ets website that there will be a huge change in the new format) so I
tried to get as much information as I can to get the bigger picture : I watched
2 videos of toefl test (lingua trip YouTube channel) one is titled the toefl
2026 structure explained ( explaining the new tasks added in the reading and
listening section) and the other one was solely for the speaking section 2026 .
Then I looked out to any materials that are solely dedicated to the new format :
Here's the most effective ones based on my experience:

the toefl ibt practice test ( there are three tests free on toefl website and
they are very similar to the real exam )

Radius English : I really liked the practice tests in this website there you can
find 3/4 tasks of each section all free *in the speaking section you can do
practice for the interview task but there's no scoring still its beneficial
cause it gives you insight about the kind of topics you can encounter in the
exam.

PrepEx AI : I really liked this website there are multiple tests for each
section so similar to the real exam and what I liked more about it is that the
tasks are made by real toefl teachers but they are not all free only the first
one or two tasks in each section( but if you can afford to pay for them do it
its really worth it )

chatgbt : I used chatgbt for almost all my writing : most of the toefl ibt new
format materials I found whether apps or online are not free so I relied on
chatgbt to revise for the writing section : he gave me templates for both write
an email and write in academic discussion , i also relied on it for evaluating
my performance in this section. The apps I used : (on play store)

toefl practice : there are two test practice for free *reading and writing
sections only*for the other section you need to pay .

toefl speaking : I liked this app so much its very useful for the listening
section ( specifically the listen and repeat task ) there are multiple tasks
with wide range of topics very similar to the ones you can find in real exam.

toefl test pro : just one word amazing! In this app you can find everything you
need almost 40 practice tests for each section and even vocabulary and grammar
practice ( most are free but for the speaking section you can do tests but the
evaluation is not for free ) but still its very useful.

toefl vocab : this app is part of magoosh platform it basically helps you
improve your vocabulary and learn new words ( there are multiple vocabulary
flashcards similar to the ones used in toefl exam ) . How i revised for the exam
:

from the start I knew my biggest challenge was the writing section ( I realized
that time was so constraint and as a person who writes very slowly and take a
lot of time to come up with ideas) I knew I needed to do as much tests as I can
( I mostly used chatgbt because as I previously said most of the practice tests
i found were not free ) chatgbt was very useful in this part evaluated my work
and provided me with a lot of tips to overcome the challenges I can face in the
exam day * by the way for the time i used my phone timer (10 min) as a
simulation for the real exam.

I already did the toefl practice tests whether on the toefl app or online and I
didn't really found a problem with the reading and listening section so from the
start know your challenges and work on them.

for the speaking section ( I used the TOEFL speaking app specifically for the
listen and repeat task) as I said its very useful.

For the interview task: I watched Toefl prep video titled: toefl speaking 2026
take an interview i found it very beneficial the teacher even provided a pdf
document of how you can evaluate your speaking skills in this task for free and
the areas you need to improve based on your performance.

Now I will give some insight about the exam : Almost all the videos I watched
and even the information I read online stated that this new version will be
easier than the old version(2025) that was a relief to me but one thing will be
a challenge : *Time *especially in the writing section you only have 7 min for
the write an email task and 10 min for the write in academic discussion task
that's why I really advise you guys to practice a lot under this exact time put
your phone timer and try your best to answer on time don't worry with practice
it gets significantly easier. ( when I first started practicing with the real
time as the exam i was really anxious and stressed out but because I practiced a
lot i felt kind of calm during the real exam) The exam was not very easy and not
very complex in between * I know that this answer can biased because for some
who their English is already very good the exam would look easy but for others
who are weak in my many areas the exam can look hard * so for me I can
realistically say that the new format is not too easy and not too difficult .in
between. Some important things to take into account: In the first task of the
reading section (complete the missing words) I took some time thinking about the
right words to put only to realize that I still have more than 15 exercises to
complete , so that made me a little bit anxious and I rushed to complete the
other ones before the time ends so be aware if you didnt know the missing word
move on to the other ones than come back to the one you didn't finish you will
still have time in your hand ( the texts are very short the longer ones are only
200 words and I found them easy to deal with so don't worry)

in the writing section: write an email practice as much as you can look out for
the punctuation, when to use big letters ,small letters . In the exam If you can
after carefully reading the prompt write the closing sentence beforehand and put
it at the end than start writing the body ( that will save you a lot of time and
not worry about not finishing on time).

the speaking section: in the listen and repeat task i realized that there's some
split seconds between hearing the sentence and repeating afterwards so take that
as an opportunity to write down as quickly as possible any words you hear ( that
works well specifically for longer sentences not the first two sentences which
are already 3 or 4 words no more) . Some advice:

*Dont put a lot of pressure on yourself try your best work smart not hard know
your weaknesses and work on them .

*Most of the materials I put are for free if you can afford to pay for test prep
or PrepEx mock exams or materials go ahead .

*Dont over complicate your answers especially in the writing and speaking
sections ( in both these sections i was eager to use complex sentences and
believe me it's so tiring ets wants accurate ,clear answers with less
grammatical mistakes that's it no more , It took me some time to understand this
but after I read this amazing toefl updated test overview pdf I realized how
simple the answers were and they usually get the highest score :
https://www.ets.org/pdfs/toefl/toefl-ibt-test-overview.pdf ( of course if your
writing and speaking style is evocative and very good by nature with less
grammar mistakes you don't need to change it .)

*If you feel like you did not well in some tasks dont let that influence the way
you answer the other ones( in each section toefl provided you with more than one
task to give you the chance to make up for the ones you did incorrectly so try
your best.)

At the end of the exam ets will give you your estimated score for the reading
and listening section .That's it . Thank you.
