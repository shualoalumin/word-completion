## Context

I took the new TOEFL on Jan 21, 2026 and got 6/6 in Reading, and I've also run 10+ official paid practice tests with my students.

One thing that keeps showing up in the new Reading section is a trap in the "Complete the Words" questions. Most people I talk to are still focused on the long academic passages, but **this tiny section is quietly lowering scores.**

---

## A. Why I think it matters

- Each small blank in "Complete the Words" **seems to be weighted like a full question**, similar in impact to a hard academic reading question in the paid mocks I've seen.
- Strong students (and even some TOEFL teachers I know) have still missed some of these.
- In one of my own paid mock tests, **a single typo in this section kept my Reading at 5.5 / 6 instead of 6 / 6.**

## B. Two common reasons people lose points here

1. **No systematic rule to fill the blanks.**  
   Advanced learners "feel" what word is right, but when they hit a blank they truly don't recognize, they don't have a clear method to generate possible answers.

2. **Typos.**  
   One missing letter turns a correct idea into a wrong answer. Your brain "sees" the correct word and simply skips over the mistake.

## C. Short version of how I recommend handling it

1. **Decide the part of speech first** (noun / verb / adjective / adverb) before you guess the word.
2. For tricky cases, **run through a to z in your head** to trigger your memory for the next letter.
3. **Quickly re-read each completed word** and consciously check spelling, even if you feel confident.

## Video walkthrough

If you want to see a concrete example and how I walk through it, I recorded a **6-minute breakdown** here:

It uses a simplified version of an official pattern (not a raw ETS screenshot), but the logic and the scoring impact are the same.

I'm planning to do similar short videos on Listening / Speaking / Writing traps as more people take the new test and more data comes in. If you've already tried the new version and noticed anything weird in Reading, I'd be really interested to hear your experience too.
