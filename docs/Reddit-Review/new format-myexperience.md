## Intro

Hi everyone. I passed the TOEFL iBT exam (new format) today in a test center and would like to share my experience and give you some insight about what it looks like. I only had **two weeks** to prepare. Here's what I did.

---

## 1. Getting the bigger picture

I wanted a general idea of what the new format would be like (I read on the ETS website that there would be a huge change), so I tried to get as much information as I could:

- I watched **2 videos** (Lingua Trip YouTube channel):
  - TOEFL 2026 structure explained (new tasks in Reading and Listening)
  - TOEFL Speaking section 2026
- Then I looked for materials dedicated to the new format.

## 2. Most effective materials (based on my experience)

### Official & free

- **TOEFL iBT Practice Test** – Three tests free on the TOEFL website; very similar to the real exam.

### Websites

- **Radius English** – I really liked the practice tests. You can find 3/4 tasks of each section, all free. In Speaking you can practice the interview task (no scoring), but it’s still useful for the kind of topics you’ll see.
- **PrepEx AI** – Multiple tests per section, similar to the real exam. Tasks are made by real TOEFL teachers. Not all free (first one or two tasks per section); if you can afford it, it’s worth it.
- **ChatGPT** – I used it for almost all my Writing prep. Most new-format materials (apps/sites) aren’t free, so I relied on ChatGPT for Writing: templates for “write an email” and “write in academic discussion,” plus evaluation. Very helpful.

### Apps (Play Store)

| App | Notes |
|-----|--------|
| **TOEFL Practice** | Two free practice tests – Reading and Writing only; other sections require payment. |
| **TOEFL Speaking** | Very useful for Listening (especially listen-and-repeat). Many tasks, wide range of topics, similar to the real exam. |
| **TOEFL Test Pro** | Almost 40 practice tests per section, plus vocabulary and grammar. Most free; Speaking evaluation is paid. Still very useful. |
| **TOEFL Vocab** | Part of Magoosh; vocabulary and flashcards similar to those used in the exam. |

## 3. How I revised for the exam

### Writing (my biggest challenge)

- Time felt very tight; I write slowly and need time to come up with ideas.
- I did as many tests as I could, mostly with **ChatGPT** (evaluated my work and gave tips).
- I used my **phone timer (10 min)** to simulate the real exam.

### Reading & Listening

- I’d already done the official TOEFL practice tests (app + online) and didn’t find them a problem. **Know your weaknesses and focus on those.**

### Speaking

- **TOEFL Speaking app** – especially for the listen-and-repeat task.
- **Interview task** – I watched “TOEFL Speaking 2026 – Take an Interview.” The teacher shared a free PDF on how to evaluate your performance and what to improve.

## 4. Exam day insights

### Difficulty

- The new format was **not very easy and not very complex** – in between. (This can vary depending on your level.)

### Time pressure

- Almost everything I watched/read said the new format would be easier, but **time is the real challenge**, especially in Writing:
  - **Write an email:** 7 min  
  - **Write in academic discussion:** 10 min  
- **Advice:** Practice a lot with these exact timings. Use a timer. It gets easier with practice. I was anxious at first but felt calmer on test day after practicing.

### Reading – Complete the missing words

- In the **first task (complete the missing words)** I spent too long on some blanks, then realized I still had more than 15 exercises left. I got anxious and rushed.
- **Advice:** If you don’t know a word, **move on, do the others, then come back.** You’ll have time. The texts are short (longer ones around 200 words) and manageable.

### Writing – Write an email

- Practice as much as you can. Pay attention to **punctuation and capitalization.**
- **Tip:** After reading the prompt carefully, you can **write the closing sentence first and put it at the end**, then write the body. That can save time and reduce worry about not finishing.

### Speaking – Listen and repeat

- There are **split seconds** between hearing the sentence and repeating. Use that to **jot down words as quickly as possible** (especially for longer sentences; the first two are only 3–4 words).

## 5. General advice

- **Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.** Work smart; know your weaknesses and work on them.
- **Most materials I listed are free.** If you can pay for test prep or PrepEx, go ahead.
- **Don’t over-complicate your answers** in Writing and Speaking. I wanted to use complex sentences and it was exhausting. ETS wants **accurate, clear answers with fewer grammatical errors.** After reading the [TOEFL iBT Test Overview (PDF)](https://www.ets.org/pdfs/toefl/toefl-ibt-test-overview.pdf), I saw how simple high-scoring answers often are. (If your style is already strong and clear, you don’t need to change it.)
- **If you feel you did poorly on some tasks,** don’t let that affect the rest. Each section has multiple tasks so you can make up for mistakes. Keep trying your best.

At the end of the exam, ETS gives you your **estimated score for Reading and Listening.** That’s it. Thank you.
